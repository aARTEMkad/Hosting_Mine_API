# Minecraft Hosting Backend

## About the Project

This project is an advanced backend solution tailored for seamless Minecraft server hosting and automation, leveraging Docker technology. It enables efficient deployment, real-time monitoring, and flexible configuration of Minecraft servers while ensuring a scalable and high-performance infrastructure.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Server Deployment & Configuration
- Dynamically provisions Minecraft servers in Docker containers with adjustable resource allocation (RAM, CPU, ports, and Java versions).
- Supports multiple server cores, including Vanilla, Forge, Spigot, Fabric, Paper, and Bukkit.
- Enables easy modification of server properties without manual file edits.

### Comprehensive Server Management
- Provides API-driven controls to start, stop, restart, and delete servers effortlessly.
- Securely removes server instances and their associated containers.
- Fetches and updates configuration settings remotely via API.

### Live Monitoring & Log Streaming
- Integrates WebSockets (Socket.io) for instant log updates and debugging insights.
- Tracks resource consumption (CPU, RAM, network) in real-time.
- Offers API endpoints to verify server health and uptime.

### Persistent Database Integration
- Stores vital server metadata such as names, resource usage, and container IDs.
- Ensures long-term data retention and seamless server tracking.

### Direct Console Command Execution
- Enables real-time command injection into active Minecraft servers.
- Retrieves historical logs for auditing and performance analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js & Express.js** for high-performance backend development.
- **Docker & dockerode** for scalable and isolated container management.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** for structured and persistent server data storage.
- **Socket.io** for real-time server interactions and event-driven communication.
- **File System (fs module)** for efficient handling of server files and settings.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Introducing automated backups with restoration capabilities.
- Integrating Kubernetes for enterprise-level scalability and fault tolerance.

This backend is designed to streamline Minecraft server management, reducing manual intervention while maximizing automation and efficiency.
